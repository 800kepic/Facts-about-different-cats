 <p>Classic tabbies have bold, swirling patterns, mackerel tabbies have narrow stripes, and spotted tabbies have large or small spots. Ticked tabbies don't have stripes or spots, but instead, have tabby markings on the face and agouti hairs (hairs with more than one band of color) on the body. Patched tabbies can show any one of the previous patterns, with the markings usually more apparent on the legs and head.</p>
